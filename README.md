# Hello! Welcome to Alexander Palensky's GitHub Profile

## I am a recent graduate of the University of Iowa with a Master of Science in Business Analytics. I spent my last year of school gaining practical experience through consulting (virtually) for an agricultural cooperative in Cameroon and as a Data Analyst with my university's NCAA baseball team. I am now a consultant for a professional services firm.
